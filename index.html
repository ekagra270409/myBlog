        <p>My hobby is to code many apps, games and websites. I love to code. Sometimes, I have a mood to code stuff like an app which delivers information, a calculator which can know a lot about mathematics, a story with fun characters, an art where there is an interactive artist making many pictures, a game that features scores and points to collect, a binary art which is made of black and white ones and zeros, A chatbot which can interact a user with lots of information, a chatapp which can connect people across the world, a multiplayer game which everyone can play on their mobile, a simulation that carries information in a fun and interactive way, a website which can deliver information about the world with html, css and the most amazing part for making apps and games, Javascript. I have learned many concepts like loops, variables, events, sequences, algorithms, animations, behaviours, functions, UI/UX, GUI, HTML, CSS, JS(Javascript), arrays, simulations, etc. I have discovered elements like inputs, buttons, screens, labels, checkbox, text area, slider, etc. Also, I have coded on these websites like Code.org, Thunkable, Dialogflow, Firebase, Codepen.io, Brackets, etc. With so many coding types, forms, sites, elements and projects learnt, I am now an advanced coder at a small age.</p>
